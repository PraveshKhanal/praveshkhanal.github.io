# About Page

# Work Process Section
work-process:
  - title: "Gather Requirements"
    icon: "assets/images/icons/plan.png"
    content: "When I start a new project, I gather all the requirements that needs to be met. This process acts as foundation for the rest of the processes so that there are goals that need to be met."

  - title: "Development and Iteration"
    icon: "assets/images/icons/design.png"
    content: "When I develop each component for the project, I iterate on its functionality first. Once the requirements are met functionally, I move on to the rest of the processes which involve aesthetic, documentation, communication, etc. After that, I go back and iterate on the entire component as a whole. The order of these steps may change based on the project requirements."

  - title: "Testing and Delivering"
    icon: "assets/images/icons/print.png"
    content: "Once the development and iterations are complete, the project is ready to be tested as a whole. When issues are found in this step, I go back to the deveopment and iteration step and fix the issues. Once developer testing is complete, it will move to user testing and delivering the product."
